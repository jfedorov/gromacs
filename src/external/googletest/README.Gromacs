This directory contains source code for Google C++ Testing and Mocking
Frameworks.

The code has been copied verbatim from the GoogleTest git commit with
hash 96f4ce0 by copying the following files/directories recursively.
No files were omitted or changed, consistent with the live-at-head
philosophy followed by GoogleTest.

This README.Gromacs file is new, of course.
