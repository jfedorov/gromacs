This directory contains source code for Google C++ Testing and Mocking
Frameworks.

The code has been copied verbatim from the GoogleTest git commit with
hash 96f4ce0 by copying the following files/directories recursively.
No files were omitted or changed, consistent with the live-at-head
philosophy followed by GoogleTest.

This README.Gromacs file is new, of course.

Conditional compilation based on __clang_analyzer__ is used to work
around reports from the clang static analyzer in
googletest/include/gtest/gtest-matchers.h and
googlemock/include/gmock/gmock-matchers.h.

Some warning-generation flags are removed from
googletest/cmake/internal_utils.cmake because these are not always
supported by compilers.

A clang-tidy suppression has been added to
googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-internal.h.
