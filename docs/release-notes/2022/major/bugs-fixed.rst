Fixed slight inaccuracies when using virtual sites with pressure coupling
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Virtual sites were reconstructed after the system was propagated, but before
scaling due to pressure coupling. For virtual site types which are not a linear
combination of other atoms, this is not completely correct. Since the scaling
due to pressure coupling is very small in healthy simulations, the resulting
inaccuracies are expected to have been extremely minor, and in most cases
undetectable.

Correct dVremain/dl when nstdhdl > nstcalcenergy
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When nstcalcenergy was not a multiple of nstdhdl, incorrect dVremain/dl
terms were written in the energy file. Note that all dH/dl output in
both dhdl.xvg and the energy file, which is used by e.g. gmx bar, was correct.

Removed velocity output for acceleration groups
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The reported velocity in the energy file for acceleration groups was always
zero. Now their velocity is no longer reported in the energy file.
