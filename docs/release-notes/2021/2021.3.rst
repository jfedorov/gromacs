.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on GitLab, without the
   a space between the colon and number!

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed gmxapi MD plugin binding
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Molecular Dynamics extension code was not properly handled when added to a
simulation through the gmxapi Python interface.
This meant that restraint potentials would silently fail to be applied with
gmxapi versions >= 0.1.
Updates have been applied internally to gmxapi.
Third party code should not need to be updated, but developers will
note an additional "null restraint" in
https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/tree/master/python_packaging/sample_restraint
(for illustration and testing purposes).

:issue:`4078`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix gmx nmr -viol option
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The tool would previously fail with a cryptic error.
Also enforces that this option is exclusive with other analysis modes.

:issue:`4060`

Fixed gmx dipoles -quad option
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The tool now reports correct values.

:issue:`4080`

Make sure gmx convert-tpr -until works
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This got broken during reworking the internals of the tool and didn't
calculate the number of remaining steps correctly.

:issue:`4056`

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check that necessary python modules are available
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The source code validation could otherwise fail a build with cryptic errors.

:issue:`3985`

Ensure that NB-LIB and gmxapi can be build even without tests enabled
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Could otherwise lead to cryptic build errors.

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removed performance loss in the mdrun domain decomposition
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With 16 or more so-called PP MPI ranks, the domain decomposition
repartitioning could incur large performance overheads due to a sub-optimally
sized hash table. This has now been fixed.

:issue:`4054`
